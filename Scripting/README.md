Start with NFL birthdays on gameday

## Research checkpoints

- Get every team's schedule [  ] - espn hidden API -> https://gist.github.com/akeaswaran/b48b02f1c94f873c6655e7129910fc3b &&https://www.reddit.com/r/NFLstatheads/comments/p4n7dm/can_i_pull_the_entire_seasons_schedule_down_from/
    - http://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/football/nfl/scoreboard?seasontype=2&week=${week}
- Find the players that have birthdays that match week 1 through 18 -> 


### TODO
